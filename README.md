# My-SQL-Database-Project
The goal of this project was to create a fully working Oracle transaction database that allowed new orders, queries, shipping and warehouse updates, inventory updates, aging and sales report generation, spanning six programs.
<br><br>Note: The only input needed/used are on the lines that start with "Enter". All other output is generated by the program.
<br><br><br><br>

First we'll generate a sales order by running order.sql and<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/My-SQL-Database-Project/blob/master/Order.png">
<br>
inputing the Customer's ID, the product they want to buy, 
the quantity they want to buy and what warehouse they will order from. 
<br>The output from order.sql:
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/My-SQL-Database-Project/blob/master/Ship.png">Now that we have an open sales order the next thing naturally
to do is ship the order. This is where shipped.sql is used. The sales order number is entered along with ship date and ship quantity. The program stores these in the sales order while also adjusting the warehouse inventory to account for the shipped goods.<br> The output from shipped.sql:
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/My-SQL-Database-Project/blob/master/Query.png">Next we have a query that shows an easy-to-read 
<br>view of the the selected sales order.
<br>The output from query.sql:
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/My-SQL-Database-Project/blob/master/Aging.png">Now we want to generate an aging report to see which orders have perhaps been open for a bit too long. To do this we allow the user to enter a number, and have aging.sql query for orders that have been open for past that length.
<br>The output from aging.sql:
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/My-SQL-Database-Project/blob/master/SalesReport.png">
Finally we want to generate a sales report to see how much of each product we sold each month.
<br>The output from salesreport.sql:

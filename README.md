# My-SQL-Database-Project
The goal of this project was to create a fully working Oracle transaction database that allowed new orders, queries, shipping and warehouse updates, inventory updates, aging and sales report generation spanning six programs.

First we'll generate a sales order by running order.sql and<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/My-SQL-Database-Project/blob/master/Order.png">
<br>
inputing the Customer's ID,the product they want to buy,
the quantity they want to buy and what warehouse they will order from. 
The output from order.sql:

to do is ship the order. This is where shipped.sql is used
